# Discriminant Functions
A discriminant is a function that takes an input vector *x* and assigns it to one of *K*
classes, denoted $C_k$. In this chapter, we shall restrict attention to [[linear discriminants]],
namely those for which the decision surfaces are hyperplanes. To simplify the discussion, we consider first the case of two classes and then investigate the extension to $K \gt 2$ classes.
