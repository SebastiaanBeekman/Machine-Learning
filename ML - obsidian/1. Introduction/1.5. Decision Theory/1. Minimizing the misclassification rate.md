Suppose that our goal is simply to make as few misclassifications as possible. We need a rule that assigns each value of **x** to one of the available classes. Such a rule will divide the input space into regions $R_k$ called [[decision regions]], one for each class, such that all points in $R_k$ are assigned to class $C_k$. The boundaries between decision regions are called [[decision boundaries]] or [[decision surfaces]]. Note that each decision region need not be contiguous but could comprise some number of disjoint regions. We shall encounter examples of decision boundaries and decision regions in later chapters. In order to find the optimal decision rule, consider first of all the case of two classes, as in the cancer problem for instance. A mistake occurs when an input vector belonging to class $C_1$ is assigned to class $C_2$ or vice versa. The probability of this occurring is given by
$$
\begin{align}
p(mistake) = p(x \in R_1, C_2) + p(x \in R_2, C_1) \\
= \int_{R_1}p(x, C_2)dx + \int_{R_2}p(x, C_1)dx
\end{align}
\tag{1.78}
$$
We are free to choose the decision rule that assigns each point **x** to one of the two classes. Clearly to minimize *p(mistake)* we should arrange that each **x** is assigned to whichever class has the smaller value of the integrand in (1.78). Thus, if *p(**x**, $C_1$)* > *p(**x**, $C_2$)* for a given value of **x**, then we should assign that **x** to class $C_1$. From the product rule of probability we have *p(**x**, $C_k$)* =*p($C_k$|**x**)p(**x**)*. Because the factor *p(**x**)* is common to both terms, we can restate this result as saying that the minimum probability of making a mistake is obtained if each value of **x** is assigned to the class for which the [[posterior probability]] *p($C_k$|**x**)* is largest. This result is illustrated for two classes, and a single input variable *x*, in [[Figure 1.24.png|Figure 1.24]].

For the more general case of *K* classes, it is slightly easier to maximize the probability of being correct, which is given by
$$
\begin{align}
p(correct) = \sum^K_{k=1}p(x \in R_k, C_k) \\
= \sum^K_{k=1}\int_{R_k}p(x, C_k)dx
\end{align}
\tag{1.79}
$$
which is maximized when the regions $R_k$ are chosen such that each **x** is assigned to the class for which *p(**x**, $C_k$)* is largest. Again, using the product rule *p(**x**, $C_k$)* = *p($C_k$|**x**)p(**x**)*, and noting that the factor of *p(**x**)* is common to all terms, we see that each **x** should be assigned to the class having the largest [[posterior probability]] *p($C_k$|**x**)*.
