# Regression
**Regression** is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It's used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.

An example of a regression problem would be the prediction of the yield in a chemical manufacturing process in which the inputs consist of the concentrations of reactants, the temperature, and the pressure.
